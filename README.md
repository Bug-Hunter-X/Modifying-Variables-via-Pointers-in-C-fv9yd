# Modifying Variables via Pointers in C
This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: modifying variables through pointers.  The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, which subtly misuses pointers, potentially leading to unexpected results or segmentation faults in larger projects. The `bugSolution.c` file offers a corrected version with explanations.

**Problem:** Incorrect pointer usage, leading to undefined behavior.

**Solution:**  Improved pointer handling practices are shown in the `bugSolution.c` file.
